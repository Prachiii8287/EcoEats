EcoEats is an innovative platform designed to combat food waste and promote sustainability in India by leveraging modern technologies such as AI, blockchain, and data analytics. The project addresses the pressing issue of food waste, which constitutes approximately 50% of municipal solid waste in the country, with significant contributions from weddings, restaurants, and food businesses. EcoEats offers a holistic solution by redistributing surplus food to those in need, facilitating composting for organic waste, and incentivizing sustainable behaviors through blockchain-based reward systems. A key feature of the platform is its "Green Tokens," a blockchain-powered reward system that motivates users to engage in eco-friendly practices, such as food donations and waste segregation. These tokens can be redeemed for various benefits, fostering a culture of sustainability and responsible consumption. By enhancing transparency, user engagement, and trust, EcoEats empowers individuals, businesses, and communities to minimize waste and maximize the environmental and economic value of food resources. With advanced AI tools for personalized recommendations, strong partnerships to expand its reach, and blockchain for secure and transparent transactions, EcoEats is set to create a sustainable future by addressing food waste at its source and promoting responsible practices globally.
